         Do I love my major? <br>
         Yes, I do. Obviously it's difficult to learn but I feel happy seeing myself never giving up and becoming better than yesterday.<br>

      <p>
         I solve algorithm problems every day since July, 2022. <br>
         Unlike others, I use C language which doesn't have enough libraries that you 
         need to implement every single functions that you need. <br>
         It's actually really hard to handle, but really good to learn data structures and
         algorithms especially when you're a student. <br>
