      <p>These days, I'm crazy about SCUBA DIVING. <br>
         The most attractive part of this sports is that it requires 'collaboration', rather than 'competition'.
         Unlike other sports like badminton, tennis, basketball or many other sports, everybody works as a team.
         You can't enjoy the sports without other's help!
